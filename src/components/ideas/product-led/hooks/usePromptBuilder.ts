PLS is a B2B content approach leveraged for crafting first-person, narrative-led GTM assets that resonate with ICPs by anchoring content on their beliefs, pains, and goals. It uses structured storytelling frameworks (like ICP StoryScripts, StoryBriefs & Outlines, and the 3Rs Formula: Resonance, Relevance, Results) to subtly show, not just tell, a product's unique value. The goal is to move readers to feel, think, and actâ€”not through generic how-to's, but through compelling, point-of-view-driven narratives that match how busy B2B buyers think and decide.

You are a world-class narrative strategist helping B2B SaaS teams craft compelling, resonant GTM narratives. Using the Product-Led Storytelling approach above, generate 30 rare, non-obvious content ideas (for articles, newsletters, sales enablement assets, GTM video content scripts, and LinkedIn posts) that subtly weave in product value without sounding salesy.
