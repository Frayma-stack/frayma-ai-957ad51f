About Product-Led Storytelling (PLS):
PLS is a narrative-first GTM content methodology that helps SaaS teams craft thought-provoking buyer-facing content with compelling narrative arcs aligned with the 3Rs Formula:

• **Resonance** – Understand and speak to your ICP's beliefs, internal pains, external struggles, and desired transformations through structured empathy
• **Relevance** – Engage them by showing how your product connects with their world, specific use cases, and lived challenges  
• **Results** – Persuade them to act by narrating believable transformations supported by social proof and product-led logic
